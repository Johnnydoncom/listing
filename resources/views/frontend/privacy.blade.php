This privacy policy only applies to activity, transactions and data gathered from your activities on the Griptorque.org Website, between Griptorque.org members (collectively, the "Site") but does not apply to any other website or offline point of contact between Griptorque.org, Juggle, or any other company, and consumers.</p>

                        Griptorque.org is a membership-based online debating service designed to provide an easy and free system for our members to debate each other on the Web. To accomplish this, our members create their own unique profiles and our technology provides a "ratio of disagreement" with other members based on the information that is provided. In order to do this, we must ask for certain personal information, which may or may not include: customer-specified Debate.org username, gender, age, ethnic background, appearance, religion, occupation, preference/lifestyle information, geographic location, political affiliation and other various information. This information is used by visitors and members for searching and selecting a debate opponent. Much of this information is optional, and meant to be seen by other members and visitors. Public information supplied by the user is intended to be viewed by visitors to the site.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="mt-2">Operational Communications</h3>
                    <p>
                        We may use your email address and other personal information to help us efficiently operate the Site, to contact you in connection with your activity on the Site (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails or important news that could affect your relationship with Griptorque.org), and to forward messages and debate challenges to you from other Debate.org users. These communications are known as "Operational Communications." These Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages, banner ads, newsletters, information, special offers and other promotional materials for Griptorque.org or third parties' goods or services. The Site provides you with options to decline to receive communications from Griptorque.org (other than those contained in Operational Communications). Some of these options may only be for a certain category of communications; others may be more general. By posting a profile on the Site, you are opting in to receive communications and offers sent by Griptorque.org.
